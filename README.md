# üß™ Lab Report Explainer Dashboard

This is a **Streamlit web app** that helps users understand their medical lab reports. Upload your report (CSV, Excel, PDF, or image), and the app extracts test results, checks for abnormalities, and gives **easy-to-understand explanations** with recommendations. It also uses **AI (Mistral model via Hugging Face)** for enhanced insights.

## Features
- Upload lab reports in **CSV, Excel, PDF, or image formats**.
- Extract test results using **OCR** for PDFs and images.
- Highlight abnormal results and provide explanations.
- Interactive **visual charts** of test values vs. normal ranges.
- AI-generated friendly **summary report and lifestyle recommendations**.
- Custom recommendations based on **age, gender, and lifestyle habits**.

üí° **Tip:** You can also add a screenshot of your app and a ‚ÄúDemo‚Äù section if you deploy it online. This makes it more attractive to others on GitHub.  

If you want, I can **write a fully polished README** with badges, a screenshot placeholder, and deployment instructions ready to paste in your repo. Do you want me to do that?
